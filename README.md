Transit iOS Test
Here is a simple test to understand how you organise your code and what you consider best
practices. You don’t have any restriction to realise this sample app. We would like an estimate
of the time it took you to complete the project. We are aware that a big portion of time spent on
this test will be to setup your project.
The app we’re asking you to build is a map that displays agencies (feeds) supported by Transit.
The app should show all feeds on a map. Feeds should be represented by a pin; upon tapping
that pin, a callout appears with the name of the feed and city.
Pins should use the custom image provided with this document. Color of pins should be as
follows:
- Canada: #F44336
- United States: #E040FB
- France: #3F51B5
- United Kingdom: #8BC34A
- Germany: #FFC107
- Other countries: #00BCD4

To get the list of supported feeds, use this JSON API (note that this API updates daily):
https://api.transitapp.com/v3/feeds?detailed=1

The code should be published on GitHub or Bitbucket so we can easily look at it. You may use
Objective-C or Swift.
